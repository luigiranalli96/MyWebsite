                            by First Principles and Machine-Learned Force Fields</a></h4>
                        <p><strong>Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Lorenzo Monacelli, Georg Kresse, Matteo Calandra, Cesare Franchini</strong> - Advanced Qauntum Technologies (2023)</p>
                        <p>Understanding collective phenomena in quantum materials from first principles is a promising route toward engineering materials properties and designing new functionalities. 
                            This work examines the quantum paraelectric state, an elusive state of matter characterized by the smooth saturation of the ferroelectric instability at low temperature due to 
                            quantum fluctuations associated with anharmonic phonon effects. The temperature-dependent evolution of the soft ferroelectric phonon mode in the quantum paraelectric KTaO3 in the
                             range 0â€“300 K is modeled by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by an on-the-fly machine-learned 
                             force field. The calculated data show that including anharmonic terms is essential to stabilize the spurious imaginary ferroelectric phonon predicted by DFT in the harmonic approximation, 
                             in agreement with experiments. Augmenting the DFT workflow with machine-learned force fields allows for efficient stochastic sampling of the configuration space using large supercells in
                              a wide temperature range, inaccessible to conventional ab initio protocols. This work proposes a robust computational workflow capable of accounting for collective behaviors involving 
                              different degrees of freedom and occurring at large time/length scales, paving the way for precise modeling and control of quantum effects in materials.</p>

                        <p>We demonstrate an approach for calculating temperature-dependent quantum and anharmonic effects with beyond density-functional theory accuracy.
                             By combining machine-learned potentials and the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we investigate the cubic to tetragonal transition 
                             in strontium titanate and show that the paraelectric phase is stabilized by anharmonic quantum fluctuations. We find that a quantitative understanding
                              of the quantum paraelectric behavior requires a higher-level treatment of electronic correlation effects via the random phase approximation. This approach enables
                               detailed studies of emergent properties in strongly anharmonic materials beyond density-functional theory.

                        </a></h4>
                        <p><strong>Cesare Tresca, Pietro Maria Forcella, Andrea Angeletti, Luigi Ranalli, Cesare Franchini, Michele Reticcioli, Gianni Profeta</strong> - arXiv, 2023</p>
                        <p>The discovery of ambient superconductivity would mark an epochal breakthrough long-awaited for over a century, potentially ushering in unprecedented scientific and technological advancements. 
                            The recent findings on high-temperature superconducting phases in various hydrides under high pressure have ignited optimism, suggesting that the realization of near-ambient superconductivity 
                            might be on the horizon. However, the preparation of hydride samples tends to promote the emergence of various metastable phases, marked by a low level of experimental reproducibility. 
                            Identifying these phases through theoretical and computational methods entails formidable challenges, often resulting in controversial outcomes. In this paper, we consider N-doped LuH<sub>3</sub> 
                            as a prototypical complex hydride: By means of machine-learning-accelerated force-field molecular dynamics, we have identified the formation of H2 molecules stabilized at ambient pressure by 
                            nitrogen impurities. Importantly, we demonstrate that this molecular phase plays a pivotal role in the emergence of a dynamically stable, low-temperature, experimental-ambient-pressure 
                            superconductivity. The potential to stabilize hydrogen in molecular form through chemical doping opens up a novel avenue for investigating disordered phases in hydrides and their transport 
                            properties under near-ambient conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Marios Zacharias, Jacky Evens, Feliciano Giustino, Cesare Franchini</strong> - arXiv, 2024</p>
                        <p>Accurately predicting carrier mobility in strongly anharmonic solids necessitates a precise characterization of lattice dyndamics as a function of temperature. We achieve consistency with 
                            experimental electron mobility data for bulk KTaO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>above 150~K by refining the Boltzmann transport equations. This refinement includes incorporating 
                            temperature-dependent  anharmonic phonon eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes into the electron-phonon interaction tensor, while maintaining the derivatives of the Kohn-Sham potential as computed 
                            in density functional perturbation theory. Using efficient machine-learned force fields and the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we accurately compute the dynamical matrices.
                            At room temperature, the calculated mobility for SrTiO<sub>3</sub> exceeds experimental values by an order of magnitude, whereas the overestimation for KTaO<sub>3</sub> is way less pronounced. 
                            This discrepancy is explained through the more significant electron mass renormalization near the conduction band bottom due to anharmonic electron-phonon coupling and the presence of 
                            local disorder in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
